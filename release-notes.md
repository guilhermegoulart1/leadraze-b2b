# 📦 Release v8.2.2

Conversation Assignment Error

Fixed an issue where assigning conversations would fail with a "Conversation not found" error. Conversations can now be assigned correctly without synchronization conflicts.

WhatsApp Message Delivery Issues

Resolved difficulties some customers were experiencing when sending WhatsApp messages to certain contacts. Message delivery now works consistently across all valid recipient numbers.

Conversation Filter Menu - Message Counts and Unread Notifications

Fixed the conversation filter menu (All, Unassigned, Mine, etc.) to properly display message counts for each category. Unread message notifications are now correctly shown in the side menu and top navigation bar.
