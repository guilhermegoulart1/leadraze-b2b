Performance Improvements

CRM Performance Optimization

The CRM has been significantly optimized for speed and efficiency. The leads page now loads instantly even with thousands of contacts. Infinite scroll loads leads automatically as you navigate, eliminating the need for pagination buttons. Searches run in the background without interrupting your workflow, and the system only loads necessary data to save bandwidth and memory. Experience smoother Kanban navigation, reduced wait times, and improved responsiveness on mobile devices.

Bug Fixes

Tasks Loading Indicator

Fixed the loading spinner that was not appearing when switching between "Date" and "Status" views on the Tasks page. The system now clearly indicates when data is loading.

Tasks "In Progress" Status Persistence

Fixed an issue where tasks moved to the "In Progress" column in the Kanban board would revert to "Pending" after page reload. Task status is now saved correctly and persists after refresh or navigation.
