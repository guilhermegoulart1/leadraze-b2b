Bug Fixes

Profile Picture Update

Fixed an issue where profile picture changes were not being applied after upload. The platform now correctly updates and displays the new image across all interface areas immediately after upload.

New Features

Detailed Campaign Reports

Access comprehensive analytics for each campaign directly from the campaign card. View key performance metrics including lead counts, invite acceptance rates, response rates, conversion stages, and timeline breakdowns to measure ROI and optimize future campaigns.

Campaign Page Pagination

The Campaigns page now loads results in paginated format for improved performance. Users with large numbers of campaigns will experience faster load times and smoother navigation.

Campaign Page Filters

Filter campaigns by status using the new filter bar. Quickly switch between All, In Review, Active, and Completed campaigns to focus on what matters most at any given moment.

Pending Invites Counter

A new counter displays the number of pending LinkedIn invites for each connected profile. Monitor your invite capacity at a glance and avoid exceeding LinkedIn limits.

Lead Distribution on Invite Acceptance

Leads are now distributed via round robin only after the prospect accepts the connection invite. If the invite expires without acceptance, the lead is tagged as "Invite Not Accepted" and distributed to the assigned team for alternative follow-up.

Round Robin Configuration for LinkedIn Campaigns

Configure team sector and member assignment for lead distribution during the Review step. The Start button only becomes available after round robin settings are complete, ensuring proper lead routing before campaign activation.

Automatic Lead Enrichment

When a prospect accepts a LinkedIn invite, their full profile data is automatically fetched and populated into the lead record. Get complete lead details including job title, company, location, and bio without manual data entry.

LinkedIn Campaign Dashboard

A new campaign summary page is now accessible from each LinkedIn campaign card. View all targeted profiles, invite statuses, wait times, and CRM pipeline stages in one centralized dashboard for full campaign visibility.

Sales Templates for AI Agents

Choose from world-renowned sales methodologies to configure your AI agents. Pre-built templates based on SPIN Selling, Challenger Sale, BANT, Sandler, Solution Selling, and more automatically shape your agent's personality, conversation style, and knowledge base for more strategic sales interactions.

Dark Mode

Switch between light and dark themes across the entire platform. Dark mode reduces eye strain in low-light environments and provides a modern, customizable interface. Theme preference is saved and applied automatically on each login.
