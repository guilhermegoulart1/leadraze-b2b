```

**Avoid:**
```

lead generation solution which offers multiple features...
```

### Be Concise
- Get to the point quickly
- Use short paragraphs
- Avoid long blocks of text

### Respect Timing
- Consider time zones
- Avoid late night/early morning
- Business hours preferred

### Use Appropriate Tone
- Friendly but professional
- Match the recipient's style
- Avoid excessive formality

When creating Activation Agents for WhatsApp:

1. Write your initial message
2. Keep it under 1024 characters

4. Test before launching

### Template Examples

I help similar companies automate their sales outreach.

Would you like to hear how?
```

**Follow-up:**
```
Hi {{name}}, just following up on my last message.

I know you're busy, but I think this could really help {{company}}.
Got 5 mins for a quick chat?
```
